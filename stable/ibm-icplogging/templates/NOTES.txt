On first launch, Kibana will take several minutes to complete an optimization phase. During that time you will likely have connection errors.

Once it has finished starting, Kibana can be accessed via the following URL, where <proxy_ip> refers to your IBM Cloud Private proxy server:

    http://<proxy_ip>:{{ .Values.kibana.external }}/app/kibana
